Milestone reached: (4) Fully functional client, and 2-player server

Compile the assignment: run 'make'

Set up the server: run './server 1234' (using port 1234 for example)

Connect two clients to the server to play: open two separate shell windows, make sure to be in the assignment directory, and run './client 127.0.0.1 1234' in each shell window

Once two players have connected to the game, you will be able to play by following the instructions printed on the shell.
The code is not (yet) robust against user inputs in wrong format, so please make sure to input two numbers separated by a single space to choose each move
